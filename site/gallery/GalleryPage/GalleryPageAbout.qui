		<summary>
			The GalleryPage control is the basic template for all controls in the
			QuickUI gallery. It defines the main content area of the type of page you are
			looking at right now. (This page is its own demo of the controlâ€™s behavior!)
		</summary>
		<notes>
			This control is a good example of a page template with numerous slots which
			can be filled in by setting properties on the control. For the control
			properties that point to source code, the GalleryPage control delegates
			responsibility for showing the source code to the separate SourceCode control.
