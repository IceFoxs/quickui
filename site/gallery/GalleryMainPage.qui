		This gallery shows live examples and the full source for a handful of
		simple QuickUI controls, representing a small range of whatâ€™s possible
		in QuickUI. While many UI frameworks come with a library of controls,
        the intent here is <i>not</i> to present such a library. Focus here
        rather on the general range of expression. 
        Since a key goal of QuickUI is to produce easily readable
		code, as you look at each control, ask yourself: <i>Is it easy to
		understand the usage of the control by looking at the source code
		for the demo?</i>
		</p>
		<p>
		Some of these controls are subclasses of controls defined elsewhere.
		The source code for all referenced classes is available in the
		<Link href="http://code.google.com/p/quickui/source/browse/#svn/trunk">QuickUI source code</Link>.
		</p>
		<p>
		Select a control from the pane on the left.
		</p>
		<!--
		<p>
		Because a QuickUI control is completely self-contained in a single .qui file,
		controls like these can be quickly added to a QuickUI control by just
		saving the .qui source file for the control into your project.
