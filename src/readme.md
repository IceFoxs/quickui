This is the CoffeeScript source for the QuickUI runtime, currently being
ported over from the plain JavaScript quickui.js in the /lib directory.
The compiled JavaScript built here will eventually replace the hand-written
quickui.js as the official runtime.

The source is built using Grunt.js (https://github.com/cowboy/grunt).
