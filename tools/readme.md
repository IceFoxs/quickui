### Visual Studio

The Tools.sln can be opened and built with Microsoft Visual Studio Express (which is free).
The Setup/Setup.sln project requires the full Visual Studio product.

### Mono
Tested with Mono 2.8.

If you have monotools installed, you should just be able to run `xbuild` in this directory.

And it should all work.
