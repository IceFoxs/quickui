This folder contains a sample QuickUI project useful for learning Quick UI
and performing simple QuickUI experiments. It's also meant to serve as a
basic self-documenting example of a QuickUI project. Reading this project
is another way to learn how QuickUI works, and in that regard the project
serves as a companion to the main QuickUI docs at http://quickui.org.
