This page is a typical top-level HTML page for a QuickUI app. Not much actually
goes on here except for loading the require scripts and styles sheets, and
bootstrapping the creation of a top-level control.

The following stylesheet represents the combined output of the styling for
all controls in this project (i.e., this folder and any subfolders). This
file is created by the qb build tool after all controls have been compiled
to their intermediate outputs in the /build folder. This file is simply
the concatenation of /build/*.css.

The file name is inferred from the name of the top-level folder. Since
this folder is called sandbox, this file is named sandbox.css.

<!-- The QuickUI framework runtime. It creates and manipulates controls. -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="../lib/quickui.js"></script>

<!--
This script file is the combined output of the generates JavaScript for all
controls in the project. It's essentially the .js analogue of the combined .css
stylesheet above. The generated JavaScript for each control (which you find
in the /build folder) will each have two parts. The first part will be the
result of compiling the control's markup down to JavaScript calls, which
ultimately boil down to jQuery manipulations of the DOM. The second part will
the contents of any script tag within the control markup.

The following is a typical bootstrap sequence for a QuickUI app.

<script>
/*
 * The standard jQuery ready function is invoked once the page's scripts, etc.,
 * have finished loading. This script instantiates a control at the level
 * of the page body. It could just as easily have instantiated the
 * control at any given element within the body. Controls also can be instantiated
 * at any point after the page is ready, e.g., in response to user actions.
 */
$(function() {
    
    /*
     * The actual work here is done by $.control(), the single top-level jQuery
     * plug-in defined by QuickUI. (All other framework methods are reached via a
     * jQuery subclass called Control.) The $.control() method has several forms.
     * Here it takes the name of a control class (Sample), and creates an instance
     * of that class around each control in the jQuery selector (here, body).
     */
    $("body").control(Demo);
    
});

<!--
In a pure QuickUI app, the body doesn't have any static content; the whole page
will be assembled at runtime by controls. But QuickUI controls can coexist on
pages built in other means: static HTML, traditional JavaScript, jQuery,
jQuery UI, etc.
