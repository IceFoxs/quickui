/*
 * The following is a typical bootstrap sequence for a QuickUI app.
 *
 * The standard jQuery ready function is invoked once the page's scripts, etc.,
 * have finished loading. The example instantiates a control at the level
 * of the page body. It could just as easily have instantiated the
 * control at any given element within the body. Controls also can be instantiated
 * at any point after the page is ready, e.g., in response to user actions.
 *
 * The actual work here is done by $.control(), the single top-level jQuery
 * plug-in defined by QuickUI. (All other framework methods are reached via a
 * jQuery subclass called Control.) The $.control() method has several forms.
 * Here it takes the name of a control class (Sample), and creates an instance
 * of that class around each control in the jQuery selector (here, body).
