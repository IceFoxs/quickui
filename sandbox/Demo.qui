<!--
This is the QuicKUI markup file for a top-level page. There's nothing special
about a top-level page control — this control could just as easily be hosted inside
another control — but that's how we'll use it here.

This file is compiled by invoking the qb (QuickUI build) tool on the top-level
folder for this project. This file is called Demo.qui, so compilation will generate
the intermediate outputs /build/Demo.js and /build/Demo.css. Those files will get
combined with other .js and .css output to form the project's top level generated
files, sandbox.js and sandbox.css.
-->

<!--
All control class definitions are enclosed by a "Control" tag that names the class.
Case is significant in QuickUI markup, so Control has to be capitalized. Since this
file will generate a JavaScript class, which by convention are also capitalized,
the control class name Demo is capitalized.
-->
<Control name="Demo">

<!--
The content tag (must be lowercase) defines the initial markup for a control.
When this control class is instantiated, the following elements will be added to
the DOM. This elements can be a mixture of regular HTML and additional QuickUI
controls. By convention, the content element is placed first, above style and
script elements.
-->
<content>
    
    <!-- Plain HTML; tag must be lowercase -->
    <h1>QuickUI Sandbox</h1>
    
    <UserTile name="Ann Williams" picture="resources/usertile1.png"/>
    <UserTile name="Daniel Garcia" picture="resources/usertile2.png"/>
    <UserTile>
        <name>Stacy Nakamura</name>
        <picture>resources/usertile3.png</picture>
    </UserTile>

</content>

<!--
These styles will apply to any elements contained by this control.
Since this control represents the top-level page, this styles here will
apply to the whole page.
-->
<style>
{   /* No explicit rule selector; will apply to a control's top-level element. */
    font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans serif;
    font-size: 16px;
}
</style>

</Control>
